&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are all of the statistical replication files for the manuscript. Currently available in Stata. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Importantly, the data file from GSS was too large to upload. To start from the beginning, imply use the [1972-2018 download from GSS](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/). <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, begin with our second data file. (data00-import)
