## Statistical Replication Files
Here are all of the statistical replication files for the manuscript. Currently available in Stata. <br>
Importantly, the data file from GSS was too large to upload. To start from the beginning, simply <br>
use the [1972-2018 download from GSS](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/). <br>
Otherwise, begin with our second data file. (data00-import)
