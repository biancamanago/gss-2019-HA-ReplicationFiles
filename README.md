## Statistical Replication Files
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are all of the statistical replication files for the manuscript. Currently available in Stata. Importantly, the data file from GSS was too large to import. Simply use the [1972-2018 download from GSS](https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/) to start from the beginning. Otherwise, begin with our second data file.
